        <h2>cello</h2>
          <p class="captioncello">I started playing cello in the 5th grade, but I only started playing competitively when I came to high school. Currently, I play for Chamber Strings, the highest orchestra at my school and have played for the Illinois State Orchestra through the Illinois Music Educator's Association.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiececello">Favorite piece: Lalo Cello Concerto in D Minor</p>

        <h2>piano</h2>
          <p class="captionpiano">When people ask me what my favorite instrument is, I find it hard to answer that question. Often times I find myself choosing between the cello and the piano; however, there is a certain ear and passion I have for the piano that will always pull me towards it. It is an extremely versatile instrument, that in my opinion, is easier to learn than other instruments. I started playing piano when I was about 6 years old have not stopped since. I play music from all genres, jazz to classical to rock.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiecepiano">Favorite piece: United States of Eurasia by Muse (integrates Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 beautifully)</p>

          <img class="stopbutton2" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/r/6/s/L/A/2/stop-button.svg">
        <h2>vocals</h2>
          <p class="captionvocals">I am not a professional vocalist, neither did I train to be one. But the fact of the matter is that, you don't need to be good at something to love it. Singing is a stress reliever for me; there's nothing I enjoy more than singing while I play the repetitive cadence of Clocks by Coldplay.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiecevocal">Favorite piece: Clocks by Coldplay</p>

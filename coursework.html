        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>cello</h2>
          <p class="captioncello" style=font-family:calibri>I started playing cello in the 5th grade, but I only started playing competitively when I came to high school. Currently, I play for Chamber Strings, the highest orchestra at my school and have played for the Illinois State Orchestra through the Illinois Music Educator's Association.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiececello" style=font-family:calibri>Favorite piece: Lalo Cello Concerto in D Minor</p>

        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>piano</h2>
          <p class="captionpiano" style=font-family:calibri>When people ask me what my favorite instrument is, it is hard for me to answer the question. Often times I find myself choosing between the cello and the piano; however, there is a certain sound and passion I have for the piano that always has me leaning towards it as my favorite instrument. It is an extremely versatile instrument, that in my opinion, is easier to pick up than other instruments. I started playing piano when I was about 6 years old have not stopped since. I play music from all genres, jazz to classical to rock.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiecepiano" style=font-family:calibri>Favorite piece: United States of Eurasia by Muse (integrates Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2 beautifully)</p>

        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>vocals</h2>
          <p class="captionvocals" style=font-family:calibri>I can't say I'm a professional vocalist, nor can I say that I am a "good" singer. But the fact of the matter is that, you don't need to be good at something to love it. Singing for me is usually a stress reliever; there's nothing I enjoy more than going to the piano and wailing away while I play the reptitive cadance of Clocks by Coldplay.</p>
          <p class="favoritepiecevocal" style=font-family:calibri>Favorite piece: Clocks by Coldplay</p>

    <div class="lessons">
      <h1 style=font-family:calibri><u>lessons</u></h2>
        <p class="aboutlessons" style=font-family:calibri>I am an experienced piano and cello player. I have performed on stage, in front of kids and parents, and in nursing homes. I know how to work with kids and am experienced in both instruments. My experience with kids comes from prior experience as an academic tutor, and I can say I loved the job, and I love working with kids.</p>
        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>rates</h2>
          <p class="rate1" style=font-family:calibri>20$ for 30 minutes</p>
          <p class="rate2" style=font-family:calibri>30$ for 45 minutes</p>
        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>locations</h2>
          <p class="aboutlocations" style=font-family:calibri>Lessons are at student's house or offsite location nearest to student, such as high school (Neuqua Valley High School). Can work out the details over the phone or email.</p>
        <h2 style=font-family:calibri>times and spots</h2>
          <p class="abouttimes" style=font-family:calibri>Because I am a high school student, I am only free for a certain amount of time and on specific days. Currently, my schedule is tentative and subject to change, so please call to confirm times.</p>
          <p class="aboutspots" style=font-family:calibri>My limited amount of time only allows me to teach a certain number of kids (this is not my only job, also am part-time tutor). Spots simply based upon "first-come first-serve."</p>

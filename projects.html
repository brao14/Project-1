      <p>I've worked on a varieity of different programming projects over the past couple years. This
        page will just cover a couple of the projects that I liked most. The first project is a marble
        sorter made out of VEX hardware and programmed in ROBOTC. The second is just a culmination of the skills
        I picked up interning for a Silicon Valley start-up, TipTop Technologies. With them, I learned
        how to integrate the Twitter API as well as their own API in order to do a sentiment analysis on tweets.
        Unfortunately, I do not have access to their API anymore, but I just chose to show the integration
        of the Twitter API on my website. If you wish to see the work I did with them, go ahead and check out
        my profile on GitHub.</p>
